## Definition of Progressive Web App (PWA) 
a PWA is collection of Web Apis that can progressively enhance a web resource in a way that resembles a native app. 
The backbone of this pattern is the usage of service-workers (SW from now on) in order to increase the normal browser-tab scope a website page usually lives in.  
Once installed the SW process is autonomous from the html page which brought it, it can manage features like:   
    - Offline support
    - Caching of content
    - Mediate network requests
    - Push notification

The  most visible aspect of PWA is that it makes them installable (like native apps),  
without having to pass thourgh a portal like ios app store or google play,  
the PWA is simply packaged in the html page resources,  
the details of the complementary metadata associated with the app is stored in the manifest.

So with a `manifest`, service-workers, and some progressive enhancement we've got a PWA.

Service worker scope is defined by the hierarchy of the page which brings it in.  
Usually it is placed in the homepage, so it can control the root and all the associated nested paths.

But the first step is...

## Create the SW

As far a SW integration I'll use workbox as it provides a high level api for service workers.

The config, stored in workbox-config.js, looks like this:
```js
module.exports = {
    globDirectory: "public/",
    globPatterns: [
        "**/*.{js,html,css,avif,png,jpeg,webp,jpg,woff2,woff,wasm,ico,svg,txt,xml}",
    ],
    swDest: "public/sw",
};
```
Running the [generateSW function](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/workbox-build#method-generateSW) a SW with the capability of precaching is created.  
To work the command must run on an already built version of the Astro application, therefore i configured the `build` npm script to do the operations sequentially.
```
    "build": "astro build && workbox generateSW workbox-config.cjs",
```

## Integration in Astro

To load the SW in the application root markup i created this custom astro plugin.
```ts

const mySwPlugin = options => {
  let config;
  return {
    name: "customSw",
    hooks: {
      "astro:config:done": async ({
        config: cfg
      }) => {
        config = cfg;
      },
      "astro:build:done": async args => {
        const injection = `
                    <script>
                        if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
                            window.addEventListener('load', () => {
                                navigator.serviceWorker.register('${VITE_SITE_PATH}/sw.js');
                            });
                        }
                    </script>`.split("\n").map(x => x.trim()).join("");
        const indexPath = path.join(config.outDir.pathname, "index.html");
        const indexHtml = await fs.readFile(indexPath, "utf8");
        const indexHtml2 = indexHtml.replace("</head>", injection + "</head>");
        await fs.writeFile(indexPath, indexHtml2);
      }
    }
  };
};
```

This does the injection of the SW script right before the closing `</head>` tag,  
BTW, the repo is public, [take a peek freely](https://github.com/fracalo/fcalo_blog/blob/main/astro.config.mjs#L34-L60).   

The [manifest file](https://github.com/fracalo/fcalo_blog/blob/main/static/manifest.json) is prepared manually and placed in the `static` folder (NB: in the default Astro config this maps to the `public` dir, but on the reference repo is was customized).  

The way we bring in the manifest file is a bit different than the service worker, given we don't need the built app it's loaded in the [GlobalLayout astro component](https://github.com/fracalo/fcalo_blog/blob/main/src/layouts/GlobalLayout.astro#L37-L42).  

## Conclusion

Building a PWA in Astro is easy, through the extensible nature of Astro it wasn't complex to find a solution.

At the time of writing there is no community plugin to generate and load the SW in the root of the site,  
i guess this is related to the fact that to create the SW we need to have a built version of the project.

Hopefully the manual workaround presented here is not too bad!
