By default nmcli (NewtworkManager cli) will try to obtain the ip with DHCP, and that's fine,
but if you want to set a static ip here's how:

### 1. Check the current ip/gateway address in use  
`ip addr show <dev>` for ip/subnet.  
And `ip route` to know the gateway.

This is all the information that will be needed for configuring your static network connection.


### 2. Discover where your current conf settings are
In contrast to traditional deb-sys network configuration  
(which is stored in `/etc/network/interfaces`),  
_NetworkManager_ connection conf can be found in `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`.  
There are many Gui tools that you can use to interact with configuration, but in the end it's these file that contain the information so we'll just edit these.

With `nmcli dev` you can see which device is connected, and the last column indicates the name of the file which stores the config  
(relative to `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`).


### 3. Changing the settings 
In the file you have identified in the previous step find the `ipv4` section,  
change method from `auto` to `manual`,  
add an entry with ip, subnet, gateway (info from step 1):  
`address1=<ip>/<range>,<gateway>`  
(mine looks like this `address1=192.168.42.18/24,192.168.42.1`) .


And now if you restart network manager you should be connecting through your statically assigned ip.

If you compare the output of `ip addr show <dev>` from the one you had in step1, you should notice the absence of the flag `dynamic` in the ipv4 section.
