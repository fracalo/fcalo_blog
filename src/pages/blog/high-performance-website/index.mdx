I've had this blog for quite a while, although I'm not a professional content creator I do my best at documenting my work,  
It helps me organize my thoughts and hopefully it might help others passing by.

But the intrinsic motivitation for writing content is another one, I build web products,  
and this blog is just me prototyping with whatever web-related unicorn I want to play with.

And today I want to see how I can improve my blog's lighthouse score,  
if you don't have web-dev experience and not know lighthouse you're probably not ready to go down the rabbit hole yet, 
some literature you should go through are:
  - [Lighthouse documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)
  - [Progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement)
  - [Mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)

### Custom vs fandom

Web development (like most other fields) is made of trends,  
in this sector many JS frameworks are born and die in the lifespan of a butterfly.  
Last years have been dominated by React, and the SPA bandwagon, these are awesome if you need to build applications,  
nethertheless they bring in many issues in the context of optimization:
    - The amount of javascript source files you need to download is relatively high.
    - Browser side routing are frowned upon by crawlers.
    - [Virtual dom](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html) frameworks  abstract away from the real dom through js,  
      this translates to extra resources being spent by the browser and ultimately the device.

We certainly don't need [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) capabilities to display the blog,  
but building a custom site that generates html we would need to reinvent the wheel in terms of DX and scaffolding,  
eventually I ended up choosing [Astrojs](https://astro.build/),
which transforms a component architecture into a static resource website with a state of the art compilation stage.  
being specifically built for displaying static content, it also adds lots of optimization addons.
